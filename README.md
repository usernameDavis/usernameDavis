Hello I am Lesley Davis
I am interested in running my programs for my business effectively.  Recently my OUTLOOK has taken an odd turn to which I am no fault.  
My interests are finding out why the OUTLOOK file is corrupting.  Currently it is putting all emails in a JUNK folder.
I do not know why.  I have had a Social Connector APP disinherited from my computer.  The app was not working properly.  That is what 
set off OUTLOOK and my DELL labtop seems to be labouring because of it.
